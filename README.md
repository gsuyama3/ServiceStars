# Service Stars - 5 Star Service
Our project is about keeping the U District unique as the most walkable, livable, and innovative urban center in Seattle, where the benefits of density are magnetic. We will advance the development of an online application to match community volunteers with nonprofit organizations seeking volunteers to power their events. The prototype was developed as Phase I and beta tested in spring 2024 as a proof in concept. Phase II will migrate the application to a new platform and add prioritized features to improve the app for public launch in May of 2025.

Our codebase includes a MySQL database to hold information that we ask the volunteers and the non-profit organizations for when they use our website to sign up to volunteer or create an event.

We build and deploy the code by connecting our website to the MySQL database.

We contribute to the code by making sure that their information is secure and private but also making sure they match accurately with what they put in (such as personal information and which events they signed up for).
